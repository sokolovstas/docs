You can use the promotion feature to promote code to a target environment by build number, for example,  _promote build number 42 to production_. Here are some of the benefits of using promotions:

* Create repeatable deployments
* Create an audit trail
* Reduce human error
* Segregation of duties
* Revoke developer access to server environments

# How it Works

When you promote a build, Drone creates a new build (with a new build number) that inherits its values from the build being promoted. This new build will have an event type is set to _promote_. You can reference the event type and target environment in your pipeline configuration.

When Drone executes your build, by default, it executes all pipelines and all steps defined in your yaml. You can limit pipeline and step execution by event and by target environment.

* Limit pipeline execution by target environment:

  ```yaml {linenos="table",hl_lines=["17-21"]}
  kind: pipeline
  type: docker
  name: default

  steps:
  - name: test
    image: node
    commands:
    - npm install
    - npm run test
    - npm run bundle

  - name: deploy
    image: plugins/ssh
    settings: ...

  trigger:
    event:
    - promote
    target:
    - production
  ```

* Limit pipeline step execution by target environment:

  ```yaml {linenos="table",hl_lines=["16-20"]}
  kind: pipeline
  type: docker
  name: deploy

  steps:
  - name: test
    image: node
    commands:
    - npm install
    - npm run test
    - npm run bundle

  - name: deploy
    image: plugins/ssh
    settings: ...
    when:
      event:
      - promote
      target:
      - production
  ```

* Create separate pipelines for promotions:

  ```yaml {linenos="table",hl_lines=["12-15","34-38"]}
  kind: pipeline
  type: docker
  name: build
  
  steps:
  - name: test
    image: node
    commands:
    - npm install
    - npm run test

  trigger:
    event:
    - push
    - pull_request
  
  &#45;&#45;&#45;
  kind: pipeline
  type: docker
  name: deploy

  steps:
  - name: test
    image: node
    commands:
    - npm install
    - npm run test
    - npm run bundle

  - name: deploy
    image: plugins/ssh
    settings: ...

  trigger:
    event:
    - promote
    target:
    - production
  ```

# How To Promote

You can promote builds using the command line utility:

* Use the build [promote]({{< relref "/cli/build/drone-build-promote.md" >}}) command:

    ```
    $ drone build promote <repo> <number> <environment>
    ```
* Example promotes build number 42 to staging:

    ```
    $ drone build promote octocat/hello-world 42 staging
    ```
* Example promotes build number 42 to production:

    ```
    $ drone build promote octocat/hello-world 42 production
    ```

_In the above examples we reference staging and production environments, however, the environment is a freeform field. You can use any environment name._
